# RPG SAGA - CONSOLE GAME

## Project Overview
Welcome to RPG Saga, a console-based game built using Node.js. In this game, characters with unique attributes such as Health Points (HP) and Attack Points (AP) participate in a thrilling tournament. Engage in battles, execute regular and special attacks, and emerge as the ultimate champion!

## Scope
* Create a console-based game with characters participating in a tournament.
* Define character attributes such as HP and AP.
* Simulate battles between characters, announcing the winner of each match.
* Implement rounds based on the number of players.

## Objectives
* Utilize Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and SOLID principles for game logic.
* Implement abstract classes and interfaces to structure the code.
* Utilize getter and setter methods for efficient data handling.

## Role
* Designing game mechanics, character attributes, attacks, and special moves.
* Implementing game logic using Node.js.
* Testing and debugging to ensure a smooth gaming experience.
* Providing weekly demonstrations showcasing progress, including the final game version.

## Technologies Used

### Technologies
* **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript with static typing.
* **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for executing code server-side.

### Frameworks
* **Jest**: A JavaScript testing framework for testing code, including React applications.

### Tools
* **ESLint**: Identifies and fixes problems in JavaScript or TypeScript code.
* **Prettier**: A code formatter enforcing a consistent code style.
* **Prompt**: Libraries for handling user input through the console.
* **Winston**: A logging library for Node.js applications.

## Challenges and Problem-Solving
* TypeScript Integration and Learning Curve
Integrating TypeScript into the project may pose challenges. The team will focus on adapting to the learning curve, ensuring everyone is comfortable with TypeScript.
* Console Input/Output Handling
Managing user input and output in a console-based game, particularly dealing with interactive prompts, is a challenge that will be addressed to enhance the user experience.
* Start Game
The initial run of the code allows users to dynamically create heroes. This can be achieved by loading data from a file or generating random heroes based on user input, selecting the desired number of heroes.
